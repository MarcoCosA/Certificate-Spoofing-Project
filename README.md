ARPPoisoning.PNG demonstrates how the ARPSpoof library can be utilized to mislead a user's computer into redirecting data intended for the legitimate gateway to the attacker's computer. This image illustrates a successful ARP poisoning attempt, indicating that traffic meant for the gateway is now being rerouted to the attacker's computer.

By obtaining a trusted certificate or exploiting a vulnerability in a user's browser, an attacker can further compromise the user's browser. This compromise could allow the attacker to decrypt, view, and modify any intercepted data, which may include sensitive personal information, login credentials, and financial transactions. This level of compromise highlights the potential risks associated with ARP spoofing and underscores the importance of securing networks against such attacks.
